JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications. This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of Java¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track. As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to: - Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data - Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques - Script the browser and make basic web applications - Use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers - Harness Node.js to build servers and utilities Isn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web? * All source code is available online in an inter¬active sandbox, where you can edit the code, run it, and see its output instantly.","textSnippet":"As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781593279509"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1593279507"}],"accessViewStatusEmbeddable":"NONE","epubIsAvailable":false,"pdfIsAvailable":false,"etag":"lbWEYs2Sla4","id":"DECQEAAAQBAJ","moreInfo":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Eloquent_JavaScript_3rd_Edition.html?hl=&id=DECQEAAAQBAJ","favorite":true,"tag":[["reading","#009016"],["webdev","#9e07d5"]]},{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fi2guAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","title":"Cold-case Christianity","authors":["J.

Yet there’s a black hole at the heart of biology. We do not know why complex life is the way it is, or, for that matter, how life first began. In The Vital Question, award-winning author and biochemist Nick Lane radically reframes evolutionary history, putting forward a solution to conundrums that have puzzled generations of scientists. For two and a half billion years, from the very origins of life, single-celled organisms such as bacteria evolved without changing their basic form. Then, on just one occasion in four billion years, they made the jump to complexity. All complex life, from mushrooms to man, shares puzzling features, such as sex, which are unknown in bacteria. How and why did this radical transformation happen? The answer, Lane argues, lies in energy: all life on Earth lives off a voltage with the strength of a lightning bolt. Building on the pillars of evolutionary theory, Lane’s hypothesis draws on cutting-edge research into the link between energy and cell biology, in order to deliver a compelling account of evolution from the very origins of life to the emergence of multicellular organisms, while offering deep insights into our own lives and deaths. Both rigorous and enchanting, The Vital Question provides a solution to life’s vital question: why are we as we are, and indeed, why are we here at all?","textSnippet":"In The Vital Question, award-winning author and biochemist Nick Lane radically reframes evolutionary history, putting forward a solution to conundrums that have puzzled generations of scientists.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780393248197"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0393248194"}],"accessViewStatusEmbeddable":"SAMPLE","epubIsAvailable":true,"ePubAcsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Vital_Question_Energy_Evolution_and-sample-epub.acsm?id=hwudBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","pdfIsAvailable":false,"etag":"AdXc4qlKPe0","id":"hwudBAAAQBAJ","moreInfo":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hwudBAAAQBAJ","favorite":false,"tag":[["interestedin","#0744d5"]]},{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dnJmBMv2jUUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","title":"Man's Search for Meaning","authors":"Viktor Emil Frankl","publishedDate":"1992","pageCount":"160","averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":3280,"subject":"Fiction","printType":"BOOK","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dnJmBMv2jUUC&dq=mans+search&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","description":"\"A prominent Viennese psychiatrist recounts his experiences in a Nazi concentration camp.\"--","textSnippet":"&quot;A prominent Viennese psychiatrist recounts his experiences in a Nazi concentration camp.&quot;--","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0807014265"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780807014264"}],"accessViewStatusEmbeddable":"NONE","epubIsAvailable":true,"pdfIsAvailable":true,"etag":"iqUKoE51G5o","id":"dnJmBMv2jUUC","moreInfo":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Man_s_Search_for_Meaning.html?hl=&id=dnJmBMv2jUUC","favorite":true,"tag":[["unfinished","#b35600"],["readnext","#b3aa00"],["interestedin","#0744d5"]]},{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HM-Y6zWNkjwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","title":"Fahrenheit 451","authors":["Ray Bradbury"],"publishedDate":"2012-01-10","pageCount":272,"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":455,"subject":["Fiction"],"printType":"BOOK","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HM-Y6zWNkjwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fahrenheit+451&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","publisher":"Simon and Schuster","description":"Ray Bradbury's internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 is a masterwork of twentieth-century literature set in a bleak, dystopian future. Guy Montag is a fireman. In his world, where television rules and literature is on the brink of extinction, firemen start fires rather than put them out. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn't live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television. When Mildred attempts suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known. He starts hiding books in his home, and when his pilfering is discovered, the fireman has to run for his life.","textSnippet":"Originally published: New York: Ballantine Books, 1953.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781451673265"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1451673264"}],"accessViewStatusEmbeddable":"SAMPLE","epubIsAvailable":false,"pdfIsAvailable":false,"etag":"olLXTI26LAw","id":"HM-Y6zWNkjwC","moreInfo":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Fahrenheit_451.html?hl=&id=HM-Y6zWNkjwC","favorite":false,"tag":[["unfinished","#b35600"],["readnext","#b3aa00"],["interestedin","#0744d5"]]},{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f1C9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","title":"The Immortality Key","authors":["Brian C.

A groundbreaking dive into the role psychedelics have played in the origins of Western civilization, and the real-life quest for the Holy Grail that could shake the Church to its foundations. The most influential religious historian of the 20th century, Huston Smith, once referred to it as the \"best-kept secret\" in history. Did the Ancient Greeks use drugs to find God? And did the earliest Christians inherit the same, secret tradition? A profound knowledge of visionary plants, herbs and fungi passed from one generation to the next, ever since the Stone Age? There is zero archaeological evidence for the original Eucharist – the sacred wine said to guarantee life after death for those who drink the blood of Jesus. The Holy Grail and its miraculous contents have never been found. In the absence of any hard data, whatever happened at the Last Supper remains an article of faith for today’s 2.5 billion Christians. In an unprecedented search for answers, The Immortality Key examines the archaic roots of the ritual that is performed every Sunday for nearly one third of the planet. Religion and science converge to paint a radical picture of Christianity’s founding event. And after centuries of debate, to solve history’s greatest puzzle. Before the birth of Jesus, the Ancient Greeks found salvation in their own sacraments. Sacred beverages were routinely consumed as part of the so-called Ancient Mysteries – elaborate rites that led initiates to the brink of death. The best and brightest from Athens and Rome flocked to the spiritual capital of Eleusis, where a holy beer unleashed heavenly visions for two thousand years. Others drank the holy wine of Dionysus to become one with the god. In the 1970s, renegade scholars claimed this beer and wine – the original sacraments of Western civilization – were spiked with mind-altering drugs. In recent years, vindication for the disgraced theory has been quietly mounting in the laboratory. The constantly advancing fields of archaeobotany and archaeochemistry have hinted at the enduring use of hallucinogenic drinks in antiquity. And with a single dose of psilocybin, the psychopharmacologists at Johns Hopkins and NYU are now turning self-proclaimed atheists into instant believers. But the smoking gun remains elusive. If these sacraments survived for thousands of years in our remote prehistory, from the Stone Age to the Ancient Greeks, did they also survive into the age of Jesus? Was the Eucharist of the earliest Christians, in fact, a psychedelic Eucharist? With an unquenchable thirst for evidence, Muraresku takes the reader on his twelve-year global hunt for proof. He tours the ruins of Greece with its government archaeologists. He gains access to the hidden collections of the Louvre to show the continuity from pagan to Christian wine. He unravels the Ancient Greek of the New Testament with the world’s most controversial priest. He spelunks into the catacombs under the streets of Rome to decipher the lost symbols of Christianity’s oldest monuments. He breaches the secret archives of the Vatican to unearth manuscripts never before translated into English. And with leads from the archaeological chemists at UPenn and MIT, he unveils the first scientific data for the ritual use of psychedelic drugs in classical antiquity. The Immortality Key reconstructs the suppressed history of women consecrating a forbidden, drugged Eucharist that was later banned by the Church Fathers. Women who were then targeted as witches during the Inquisition, when Europe’s sacred pharmacology largely disappeared. If the scientists of today have resurrected this technology, then Christianity is in crisis. Unless it returns to its roots.

Tolkien’s classic masterpieces behind the films... This special 50th anniversary edition includes three volumes of The Lord of the Rings (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King), along with an extensive new index—a must-own tome for old and new Tolkien readers alike. One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion. When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom. The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider. J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973), beloved throughout the world as the creator of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. His chief interest was the linguistic aspects of the early English written tradition, but while he studied classic works of the past, he was creating a set of his own.","textSnippet":"J.R.R.
